# Implementation of Priority Queue using a Heap and Testing the performance of QuickSort and HeapSort Algorithms

## Overview

The project consists of a HeapPQueue class that implements a priority queue using the binary heap data structure. The class implements the PQueue interface that contains the necessary methods to be found in a priority queue which are to be implemented in the HeapPQueue class.
The SortingTest class contains the heapSort  and quickSort methods which I implemented and tested their performance against each other. The SortingTest class also contains a static main method which contains code to test the performance of a heapSort and quickSort against each other.

## Testing Methods in HeapPQueue Class

* To test the methods in the HeapPQueue I created a static main method in the class.

* To access list in the main method without throwing a null pointer error when utilizing it, I made the list array to be static.

* The args-constructor can be initialized with an array passed to it.
